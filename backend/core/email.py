"""
Outbound email primitive.

This is deliberately small and generic (send_email(to, subject, body)) —
the only current caller is AuthService's password-reset flow, so there's
no separate EmailService abstraction layer; composing the reset email's
subject/body lives in AuthService, right next to the workflow it belongs to.
If a second use case shows up (e.g. "ticket assigned to you" notifications),
that's the signal to extract a proper EmailService.

Zero new dependencies: smtplib and email.mime are both in the Python
standard library. No SendGrid/Mailgun/SES SDK needed for this project's
scale, and it keeps local dev working without any third-party account.

Dev-mode fallback: if SMTP isn't configured (the common case for local
development — nobody wants to set up a real mailbox mid-tutorial), the
email is logged instead of sent. This is a deliberate, visible fallback
(not a silent swallow) — the log line makes it obvious in development
that "sending" is actually just printing, and it's exactly what you'd
disable by setting SMTP_HOST in production.
