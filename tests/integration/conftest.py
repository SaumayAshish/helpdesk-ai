"""
Shared fixtures for integration tests.

Unlike tests/unit (services tested in isolation with MagicMock models),
integration tests exercise the real stack: HTTP request -> FastAPI
routing -> dependency injection -> service -> repository -> a real
Postgres database -> response. The trade-off is setup cost, which is
why this file exists — every integration test file reuses these
fixtures instead of wiring the database up itself.

Requires a running test Postgres instance:
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.test.yml up -d

Points at it via TEST_DATABASE_URL (defaults to the docker-compose.test.yml
service). Override the env var if you're running Postgres somewhere else.
